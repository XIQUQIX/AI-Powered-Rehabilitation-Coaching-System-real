# AI-Powered-Rehabilitation-Coaching-System

Our final project purpose is to build an end-to-end prototype of an at-home RAG coaching agent that can act in place of a physical therapist to provide medical feedback to a patient when they are performing rehabilitation exercises. We are a group of 4, Jason, David, Andre and Rongjia, working together as Masters students as part of our Northeastern Data Science Capstone course. This project addresses what we believe is the under-served at-home phase of injury recovery utilizing a multimodal AI coaching agent that combines computer-vision-based (CV) movement analysis with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework to deliver real-time, clinically grounded feedback during otherwise unsupervised patient physiotherapy exercise. While grounding both the CV and RAG pipelines in applied research, our focus was to build out a functional minimum viable product that is deployable on consumer hardware, especially inexpensive smartphones, and that, while requiring internet connectivity for LLM API prompting, minimizes computational costs.

## 🎯 The Problem

Injury rehabilitation fundamentally depends on the correct, consistent execution of prescribed exercises over an extended recovery period. In clinical settings, the physiotherapist provides real-time observational feedback such as identifying compensatory movements, unsafe loading patterns, and deviations from prescribed form, and then adjusts the exercise program as the patient progresses. Once discharged to home-based care, patients lose access to this supervisory feedback loop entirely. 

This project frames the core challenge as a multi-task machine learning problem combining three distinct components:
• Multi-label movement quality classification. Given a variable-length video sequence of a patient performing a rehabilitation exercise, simultaneously classify exercise identity, form errors, movement speed, range of motion, torso orientation, and lateral direction.
• Retrieval-augmented coaching feedback generation. Given a detected movement error and its clinical context, retrieve the most relevant physiotherapy guidance from a curated medical corpus and generate patient-facing coaching feed-back that is accurate, safe, and actionable. 
• Stateful multi-agent orchestration (integration layer). Route detected errors through a three-tier response system: cached responses for
known patterns, RAG-grounded LLM generation for novel errors, and full multi-step agent reasoning for persistent or complex cases

## 🚀 Our Solution

**Virtual Physiotherapy Assistant (VPA)** is an intelligent AI system that acts as your personal virtual physiotherapist — available anytime, anywhere, directly from your phone or webcam.

### Core Capabilities

- **Real-time pose estimation & movement analysis** — Uses your camera to track body keypoints and evaluate exercise execution.
- **Detailed, constructive feedback** — Tells you exactly what you're doing **correctly**, **moderately well**, or **poorly**, with specific, actionable suggestions to correct form (e.g. "Keep your knee aligned over your ankle — try shifting weight slightly forward").
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** recommendation engine — Personalizes advice based on:
  - Your specific injury / condition
  - Doctor / physiotherapist recommendations
  - Evidence-based rehab protocols for common injuries
- **Patient-centric design** — Aims to increase adherence through clear, encouraging, human-like coaching.

The goal is simple: help people recover **faster**, **safer**, and **more consistently** from home — while reducing the burden on healthcare systems.

## ✨ Key Features (Initial Version)

- Video-based real-time exercise assessment
- Multi-level feedback (good / moderate / needs improvement)
- Personalized recommendations via RAG (injury-specific + protocol-aware)
- Chat interface for asking questions about exercises, pain, or progress
- (Planned) Progress tracking & adherence reports

## 🛠️ Technology Highlights

- **Computer Vision** → Human pose estimation (likely MediaPipe / OpenPose / RTMPose family)
- **AI Feedback Engine** → LLM-powered critique + natural language generation
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** → For retrieving and grounding advice in trusted physiotherapy knowledge
- **Frontend** → (Web / mobile app — webcam access)
- **Backend** → Python-based inference pipeline
