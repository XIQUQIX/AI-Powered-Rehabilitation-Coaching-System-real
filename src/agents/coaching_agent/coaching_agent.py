"""
CoachingAgent — thin class wrapper around the existing LangGraph graph.

Responsibilities
----------------
- Owns a compiled LangGraph instance (create_coaching_graph()).
- Exposes handle_event(event: CoachingEvent) -> str which translates a
  CoachingEvent dataclass into the exact state dict the graph already expects,
  invokes the graph, and returns the feedback_audio string.

Everything inside create_coaching_graph() is unchanged.
